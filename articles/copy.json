The aircraft suffered an [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]] from an incorrectly repaired [[aft pressure bulkhead]], which failed in mid flight, destroying most of its vertical stabilizer, severing all of the hydraulic lines, making the 747 virtually uncontrollable. Pilots were able to keep the plane flying for 20 minutes after departure before crashing into a mountain. Remarkably, several people survived, but by the time the Japanese rescue teams arrived at the crash site, all but four had succumbed to their injuries.<ref>{{cite web|last= Kilroy|title=Special Report: Japan Airlines Flight 123|url= http://www.airdisaster.com/special/special-jal123.shtml |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= AviationSafetyNetwork|title=Accident description|url= http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19850812-1|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Other crashes with high death tolls ===\nOn 8 March 2014, [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], flying from [[Kuala Lumpur]] disappeared with 239 people on board.\n\nOn 1 June 2009 [[Air France Flight 447]] was a scheduled international flight from Gale\u00e3o International Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, France when the Airbus A330-203 airliner serving the flight stalled and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the deaths of all 216 passengers and 12 aircrew. The accident was the deadliest in the history of Air France. It was also the Airbus A330's second and deadliest fatal accident, and its first while in commercial passenger service.\n\nOn 12 November 2001, [[American Airlines Flight 587]], an [[Airbus A300]], crashed in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of [[Queens]], New York, just after departing [[John F.

Although Concorde jets had a very good safety record with no previous crashes, this event was the beginning of the end for the aircraft; the high-prestige supersonic plane was retired from service by both [[British Airways]] and [[Air France]] in 2003. The official finding traced the cause of the fuel tank rupture to the plane's impact with an aircraft part on the runway that had fallen off a previously departed airliner. According to the documentary \"Counterfeit culture\", the crash in part was due to the use of a counterfeit component on that aircraft.<ref>[http://www.techvibes.com/blog/counterfeiting-in-canada-2013-01-24 Counterfeit culture documentary blaming the Air France Flight 4590 crash partly on the use of counterfeit components; it also states that many other airplane crashes could be caused by counterfeit components]</ref>\n\nOn 31 October 1999, around 01:50 EST, in international waters, [[EgyptAir Flight 990]] (MSR990) crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, about {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts,  killing all 217 people on board.

However the aircraft was not evacuated and all 301 passengers and crew died in the fire.\n\nOn 25 May 1979, [[American Airlines Flight 191]], following improper maintenance and the loss of an engine, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10]], lost control and crashed near [[O'Hare International Airport]] in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]].

The London-bound plane crashed shortly after taking off from Orly airport; all 346 people on board died. It was later determined that the cargo door detached, which caused an explosive decompression; this caused the floor just above to collapse. The collapsed floor severed the control cables, which left the pilots without control of the elevators, the rudder and No. 2 engine. The plane entered a steep dive and crashed.

In modern times, two major manufacturers still produce heavy passenger aircraft for the civilian market: [[Boeing]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], and the [[Europe]]an company [[Airbus]]. Both place huge emphasis on the use of aviation safety equipment, now a billion-dollar industry in its own right; for each, safety is a major selling point\u2014realizing that a poor safety record in the aviation industry is a threat to corporate survival.

Statistics are grouped according to type of operation, for instance, commercial air transport, and aircraft category, such as aeroplanes, helicopters, gliders, etc.\nThe Agency has access to accident and statistical information collected by the [[International Civil Aviation Organisation]] (ICAO).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.easa.europa.eu/what-we-do.php|title=European Aviation safety Agency|date=9 May 2012 |publisher=EASA}}</ref> States are required, according to ICAO Annex 13, on Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation, to report to ICAO information, on accidents and serious incidents to aircraft with a maximum certificated take-off mass (MTOM) over 2250&nbsp;kg. Therefore, most statistics in this review concern aircraft above this mass. In addition to the ICAO data, a request was made to the EASA Member States to obtain light aircraft accident data. Furthermore, data on the operation of aircraft for commercial air transport was obtained from both ICAO and the [[NLR Air Transport Safety Institute]].<ref>http://www.nlr-atsi.nl</ref>\n\n==Investigation==\n{{Category see also|Organizations investigating aviation accidents and incidents}}\n\nAnnex 13 of the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Convention]] provides the international [[Standards And Recommended Practices]] that form the basis for air accident and incident investigations by signatory countries, as well as reporting and preventative measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.icao.int/eshop/pub/anx_info/an13_info_en.pdf|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=9 January 2012|title=Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation: Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation}}</ref>  The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) is specifically focused on preventing accidents, rather than determining liability.\n\n===Australia===\nWithin Australia, the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] is the federal government body responsible for investigating transport-related accidents and incidents, covering air, sea, and rail travel.
